# Rationality Taboo

## TODO

Add phrases from sequences, e.g. Making Beliefs Pay Rent

Add some commentary - suggest people don'e worry about exact wording - "make beliefs pay rent" is fine too

Provide info for people who want to add choices

Add more content - get csv from sky

Allow people to "join a game" like jackbox games - 4 letter code or something.

Multiple screens - clue giver, censor, "not your turn yet" - should that page list that order that people will be in?
* i think the censor should be the person who went last.

* separate clues by difficulty? e.g. coherent extrapolated volution is hard mode?
